## Hints 'n' Tricks
This repository is a collection of some *Hints 'n' Tricks* for Scala. The examples are mostly test's and a short description can 
be found in the module itself.


### [Currying](currying/readme.md)
Break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take part of the arguments.

### [Deconstruction](deconstruction/readme.md)
Decompose a (complex-)object into its class variables

### [Varargs](varargs/readme.md)
*Variable Arguments* some sort of syntax that can handle an arbitrary number of parameters automatically â€“ (using an array under 
the hood.)
